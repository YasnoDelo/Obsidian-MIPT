### Why does it exist?
Because [[MAC|MAC addresses]] are not hierarchical.

### Addresses

^69527c

length: 32 bytes $\Rightarrow$ $2^{32}$ variants of addresses 

Four octets:

| 1    | 2    | 3    | 4   | info                     |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ------------------------ |
| 192. | 168. | 15.  | 47  | usual                    |
| 255. | 255. | 255. | 255 | [[Broadcast\|broadcast]] |

### Header format

^157405

Minimum size is 20 byte!

### Fragment division
If length of [[UDP]] data (for example) is too much for packet, it divides into parts 

Is field [[IPv4#^082ef4|total length]]

### [[ARP]] & [[proxy-ARP]]
Help to understand [[MAC]], knowing IP

### How I understand is device in my subnet
Knowing mask, I calculate network address. If device's address located here, here it is!

### [[ICMP]]
