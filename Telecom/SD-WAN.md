**Software-Defined Wide Area Network**

A method of organizing a network in which all branch devices perform only [[Data plane|data plane]] duties. [[Control plane]] duties are performed by a special controller, to which all end devices are connected (fills [[ARP]] tables, [[Routing|routing tables]]). [[Management plane]] duties are performed by an orchestrator, which, among other things, monitors the controller (see versions, loads configs)
